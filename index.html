<h1 style= "padding:50px; margin:50px;">About the Author</h1>
<img src = "IMG/profile.jpg">
<p style= "padding:50x; margin:50px;">As a matter of introduction, I am a French national, trilingual language teacher with experience at Primary, Middle and Senior school level. I have been teaching for the past 15 years in various school across Asia including Marlborough College Malaysia, Merchiston International School in China and UWCSEA in Singapore, as well as being a tutor at Nanyang Technological University (NTU).
I started writing books when I realized there was a crucial gap in the market — a lack of bilingual books that truly met the needs of my students. I was finding challenging to find books that were both educational and engaging, and corresponded to the curriculum I was teaching.
The books I write are a resource for students, parents, and schools who are looking for bilingual reading materials which are fun, entertaining and educational. Some of the books also include teaching materials to help teachers.
I have published about 15 books so far (5 activity books and 10 reading books with audio). They all have been published on Amazon (KDP).</p>
